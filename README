Experimental.

Older templating plugins for VIM often used simple markup for placeholders (e.g. <+VARIABLE_NAME+>). A placeholder was simply a pattern you could easily search for. Some newer templating plugins support dynamic replacement of placeholders with the same name.

The stakeholders plugin turns your old templating system into a high  potential overachiever. It provides dynamic replacement of placeholders with the same name/ID for older templating plugins. By default, it assumes placeholders match /<+\([[:alpha:]_]\+\)+>/ since this pattern is used in several templating systems (e.g., vimscript #1160). You can easily change that pattern by setting |g:stakeholders#def| or b:stakeholders_def.


Usage~

The tskeleton templating plugin provides a parameter (|g:tskeleton#enable_stakeholders|) that enables integration with the stakeholders plugin. For other templating plugins, you have to enable stakeholders by calling either |stakeholders#EnableBuffer()| or |stakeholders#EnableInRange()|.
